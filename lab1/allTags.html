                        Books have been a part of our daily lives since ancient times.
                        They have been used for telling stories, archiving history, and sharing
                        information about our world. Although the ways that books are made have
                        evolved over time, whether handwritten, printed on pages, or digitized
                        online, their need remains timeless.

                                When writing systems were created in ancient
                                civilizations, a variety of objects, such as stone,
                                clay, tree bark, metal sheets, and bones, were used
                                for writing; these are studied in epigraphy.
                            </p></li>

                                A <u>tablet</u> is a physically robust writing medium,
                                suitable for casual transport and writing. Clay tablets
                                were flattened and mostly dry pieces of clay that could
                                be easily carried, and impressed with a stylus. They
                                were used as a writing medium, especially for writing
                                in cuneiform, throughout the Bronze Age and well into
                                the Iron Age.

                                <u>Scrolls</u> can be made from papyrus, a thick paper-like
                                material made by weaving the stems of the papyrus plant,
                                then pounding the woven sheet with a hammer-like tool until it is
                                flattened. Papyrus was used for writing in Ancient Egypt, perhaps
                                as early as the First Dynasty, although the first evidence is
                                from the account books of King Neferirkare Kakai of the Fifth
                                Dynasty (about 2400 BC). Papyrus sheets were glued together to
                                form a scroll. Tree bark such as lime and other materials were
                                also used.

                                A <u>codex</u> (in modern usage) is the first information repository
                                that modern people would recognize as a "book": leaves of uniform size
                                bound in some manner along one edge, and typically held between two
                                covers made of some more robust material. The first written mention of
                                the codex as a form of book is from Martial, in his Apophoreta CLXXXIV
                                at the end of the first century, where he praises its compactness.

                                The fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century AD saw the decline of the
                                culture of ancient Rome. Papyrus became difficult to obtain due to lack of
                                contact with Egypt, and parchment, which had been used for centuries, became
                                the main writing material.
                                The scriptorium of the monastery was usually located over the chapter house.
                                Artificial light was forbidden for fear it may damage the <u>manuscripts</u>.
                                For very luxurious manuscripts the whole parchment was colored purple, and
                                the text was written on it with gold or silver (for example, Codex Argenteus).

                                In <u>woodblock printing</u>, a relief image of an entire page was carved into
                                blocks of wood, inked, and used to print copies of that page. This method
                                originated in China, in the Han dynasty (before 220 AD), as a method of printing
                                on textiles and later paper, and was widely used throughout East Asia.

                                Steam-powered printing presses became popular in the early 19th century.
                                These machines could print 1,100 sheets per hour, but workers could only set
                                2,000 letters per hour. <u>Monotype</u> and <u>linotype</u> typesetting
                                machines were introduced in the late 19th century.

                                Throughout the 20th century, libraries have faced an ever-increasing rate of
                                publishing, sometimes called an information explosion. The advent of electronic
                                publishing and the internet means that much new information is not printed in
                                paper books, but is made available online through a digital library, on CD-ROM,
                                in the form of ebooks or other online media. An <u>on-line book</u> is an ebook
                                that is available online through the internet.
