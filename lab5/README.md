Solved the following task using jQuery:\
Web page which contains a form with 5 input fields and a button. 
If the user clicks on that button a modal interface window (actually a div) pops out in the center of the browser window. 
This modal window contains 4 input fields and a button. If the user clicks on that button, the modal window disappears and
all the values inserted by the user in the modal window's input fields will be concatenated and added to a text field in the main form. 
During the time the modal window is displayed, the fields from the main form will be inactive and a transparrent gray div is displayed on top of the web page 
(this grey div is beneath the modal window and occupies the whole browser window).
